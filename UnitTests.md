# Mercado Pago SDK for .Net

## Running unit tests

In order to successfully run the unit tests in this solution you need the following `Environment Variables` set up in your dev box:

  - `ACCESS_TOKEN`  = [your_access_token]
  - `CLIENT_ID`     = [your_client_id]
  - `CLIENT_SECRET` = [your_client_secret]
  - `PUBLIC_KEY`    = [your_public_key]

You can obtain your MercadoPago credentials [here](https://www.mercadopago.com/mla/account/credentials?type=basic)

if you're using Visual Studio, you'll probably need to restart it once you've setup the Environment Variables.
